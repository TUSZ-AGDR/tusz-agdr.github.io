abstract: In robotic bimanual teleoperation, multimodal sensory feedback plays a crucial role, providing operators with a more immersive operating experience, reducing cognitive burden and improving operating efficiency. In this study, we develop an immersive bilateral isomorphic bimanual telerobotic system, which comprises dual arms and dual dexterous hands, with visual and haptic force feedback. To assess the performance of this system, we carried out a series of experiments and investigated the user's teleoperation experience. The results demonstrate that haptic force feedback enhances physical perception capabilities and complex task operating abilities. In addition, it compensates for visual perception deficiencies and reduces the operator's work burden. Consequently, our proposed system achieves more intuitive, realistic and immersive teleoperation, improves operating efficiency and expands the complexity of tasks that robots can perform through teleoperation.
