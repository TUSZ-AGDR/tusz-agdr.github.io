abstract: "Underwater object detection (UOD) is crucial for monitoring marine ecosystems, underwater robotics, environmental protection, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite progress, many models struggle under real-world conditions due to poor visibility, dynamic lighting, and domain shifts. Traditional methods like Faster R-CNN are computationally expensive, while YOLO-based models suffer in challenging underwater scenarios. The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets further limits model generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce UOD-SZTU-2025, a new dataset of 3,133 high-quality underwater images, sourced primarily from video platforms. The dataset is used in EFCWM (Enhanced Feature Correction and Weighting Module) to extract and refine a feature material library for detection targets. We propose EFCWM-Mamba-YOLO, a lightweight, real-time detection model designed to enhance feature representation and adapt to diverse underwater environments. The EFCWM module incorporates domain adaptation for improved robustness. Additionally, a two-stage training strategy first trains on a source domain and fine-tunes with limited target domain samples to enhance generalization. Experiments show our approach surpasses existing lightweight UOD models in accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. Our dataset, model, and benchmark establish a strong foundation for future UOD research. The dataset for EFCWM-Mamba-YOLO is available at https://github.com/wojiaosun/UOD-SZTU-2025."
