abstract: This review focuses on touching-based underwater robotic perception and manipulation, and provides a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape. We begin by examining underwater tactile sensors, discussing their basic types and recent advancements that have facilitated their integration into underwater robotic manipulation. Additionally, we explore the development of force control algorithms for underwater manipulators and grippers, emphasizing their critical role in underwater environments. Furthermore, we analyze the application of force control algorithms in underwater robotic manipulation, considering different autonomy levels, basic manipulation tasks, and specific operational scenarios. Through this investigation, we identify existing limitations and propose future research directions aimed at enhancing the operational capabilities of underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) and expanding their application range. Finally, this review highlights key challenges and outlines pathways for advancing the field.
