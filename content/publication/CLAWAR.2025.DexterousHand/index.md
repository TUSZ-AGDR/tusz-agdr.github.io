abstract: In this work, the idea of full-hand tactile perception is proposed. A 4-fingered fully-actuated dexterous hand with 16 degrees of freedom (DoFs) is designed, and a novel and facile piezoresistive flexible tactile sensor is proposed and integrated on the index finger, thumb, and palm. Moreover, a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based grasp stability assessment system is introduced as a preliminary usage of full-hand tactile perception, where envelope grasp is taken into consideration along with traditional 2-finger grasp. Experimental results show precise hand movement and perception, with grasping stability evaluated correctly.
