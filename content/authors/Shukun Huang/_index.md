I am Shukun Huang, and currently studying Computer Science at Shenzhen Technology University. I previously served as the leader of the electronic control team, where I led my team in the 2024 RoboMaster Robotics Competition. I contributed to building the underlying framework for general-purpose embedded software for robots and was involved in developing 3D SLAM navigation and decision-making algorithms. I specialize in embedded development, ROS operating systems, and robot motion control. Currently, I am conducting research on the dexterous hand project in this lab
