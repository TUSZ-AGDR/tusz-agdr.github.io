Before joining the SZTU, he was a Principle Investigator at the Center for Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC) in Bielefeld University. He is also the President of Association of Chinese Computer Scientists in Germany.

From 2019 to 2020, he was a Principal Scientific Researcher and Project Leader at RoboticsX Lab. From 2012 to 2018, he was a Senior scientific researcher at Neuroinformatik group, Bielefeld University. From 2009 to 2012, he was a postdoc at CorLab, Bielefeld University. Dr. Qiang Li hold a PhD from Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2010). 

He was Involved in European project-TACHAND and also many German national projects—FAMULA, REBA, REBA+. and authored/co-authored over 50 peer-reviewed publications in the field of robotic control, grasping and manipulation area and 1 edited book. Currently Dr. Qiang Li serve as Associate Editor in International Journal of Humanoid Robotics (Robotics), Indutrial robot and Complex & Intelligent Systems (AI) and Associated Editor for top level robotics conference—ICRA, IROS, Humanoids.

He is leading the Association of Chinese Computer Scientists in Germany and developed its whole scientific organization structure and construct the Experts Committees of intelligent robots, big data and AI, Industrial IoT, autonomous driving and Brain Neurorecognition. In 2016, I founded the Sino-Germany Symposium on Intelligent Robots and developed it as a
serial robotics conference (2016,2019,2020,2021) for the researchers and engineers in the whole Europe. In 2018, he was awarded “ 10 leading Chinese Talents on Science and Technology in Europe” by Federation of Chinese Professional Associations in Europe.
