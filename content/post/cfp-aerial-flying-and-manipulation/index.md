## Overview
As aerial robots move beyond observation to active physical interaction, aerial grasping has become a frontier in robotics research. This capability unlocks a range of high-impact applications, from autonomous inspection and maintenance to disaster response, logistics, and agriculture, where access, agility, and autonomy are critical.

This special session aims to gather cutting-edge research from around the world to address these challenges and advance the science and engineering of aerial manipulation.

We invite contributions that span hardware, intelligent control, vision-guided grasping, bio-inspired systems, and real-world deployments. Through this session, we seek to foster collaboration across disciplines and accelerate innovation in this rapidly evolving field.



## Scope

- **Design and Control of Aerial Manipulators**

  Mechanical and control co-design for aerial platforms with arms, grippers, or tendon-driven end-effectors.

- **Perception and Planning for Aerial Grasping**

  Vision-based and multi-modal sensing for object detection, grasp planning, and real-time control in dynamic environments.

- **Learning-Based Approaches for Grasping in Flight**

  Application of reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and foundation models to improve grasp success and adaptability.
  
- **Cooperative Aerial Manipulation**
  Multi-drone systems performing joint manipulation tasks such as lifting large or articulated objects.

- **Bio-Inspired Grasping in Aerial Platforms**
  Biological paradigms (e.g., birds of prey, insects) used to design agile and efficient grasping strategies in flight.
  
- **Aerial Grasping in Complex Environments**
  Systems designed to grasp in cluttered, confined, moving, or GPS-denied environments such as forests, tunnels, or urban ruins.
  
- **Grasping under Flight Dynamics Constraints**
  Stability-aware grasp planning, force control, and motion compensation under aerodynamic perturbations and limited thrust.
  
- **Real-World Applications and Benchmarking of Aerial Grasping**
  Stability-aware grasp planning, force control, and motion compensation under aerodynamic perturbations and limited thrust.
