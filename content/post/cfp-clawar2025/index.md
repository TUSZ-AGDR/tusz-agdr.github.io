### CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

CLAWAR 2025 is the 28th issue of the International Conference Series on Climbing and Walking Robots and the Support Technologies for Mobile Machines. The theme of the conference this year is “AI Enabled Robotic Loco-Manipulation”, and it will be organized in collaboration with the Shenzhen Technology University, China, and held within the premises of the university, during 05 – 07 September 2025. The technical program of CLAWAR 2025 will feature plenary, regular and special/invited sessions. The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series which is indexed by Scopus and EI and submitted for consideration in Web of Science.



### SCOPE

Original contributions are invited in the area of mobile and manipulation robotics, covering climbing, walking and other robots for assistance and service provided to humans and machines. The conference will cover analysis (modelling and simulation) techniques, design approaches, and practical applications and realisations of robotic systems. Support technologies for realisation of such systems, associated economic, ethical and social considerations are integral part of the conference theme.

### About CLAWAR

CLAWAR was set up with funding from the EC as a Network of Excellence (NoE) focussing on Climbing and walking robots in February 1998 following a 6 month exploratory phase in 1996 to identify key stakeholders in the area of robotics at the EU level. 

The first phase of CLAWAR was during 1998-2002 and it was coordinated by University of Portsmouth with Professor Gurvinder S Virk as the Project Manager. The mission of CLAWAR 1 was to bring all stakeholders together in the CLAWAR area of technology to widen the application of mobile robotics with 22 key organisations active in robotics R&D. The first CLAWAR conference was held in Brussels during 1998. CLAWAR 2 was a follow on and extension project during 2002-2005; CLAWAR 2 was coordinated by University of Leeds and comprised 38 organisations from Europe and over 40 observer organisations from throughout the world. CLAWAR 2 started addressing global issues for robotics and included modularity, societal and commercialisation and helped initiate ISO robot standardisation activities to assist the emergence of new robot markets for non-industrial sectors aimed at delivering a wide variety of services. 

CLAWAR 2 ended in 2005 and CLAWAR Association Ltd was set up in March 2006 as a non-profit making membership based organisation registered in the UK at Companies House. The aim was to focus on activities to encourage the widening of the robot market sector by supporting international ISO/IEC robot standardisation activities in the emerging areas of service robots (personal and medical robots). CLAWAR Association was awarded charitable status in April 2012 and is currently registered as a charity in the UK. CLAWAR Association Limited is a UK Registered Charity with the Charity Commission (Number 1146747) and is Company Limited by Guarantee (Registration No. 5730036) with Companies House.
