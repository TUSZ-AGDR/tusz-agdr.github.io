# [Arbeit Gruppe Dexterous Robotics (AGDR) @ Shenzhen Technology University](https://github.com/TUSZ-AGDR)

Dexterous robotic manipulation is one of the top ten cutting-edge technologies in the field of intelligent robots. It is also an important breakthrough way to improve the level of intelligence society and improve peoples quality of life in the fields of industry, agriculture, medical rehabilitation and elderly care, logistics, and space/ocean. Headed by Prof. Qiang Li, the research team combines fundamental research in robotics with industry needs to lay out four key research directions （1）Robot tactile perception and control; (2)Multimodal and robotic skill learning; (3) Human-computer interaction; (4)Integration and application of intelligent robots in the Internet of Things
